## Setup

This section is meant to explain the process followed to install webpack and the specific plugins used for this project.
 - First, install the required packages that are specified in the _*package.json_* file running the below _*npm*_ command. This will create the _node_modules_ folder with all the environment dependencies.
 
 ```` npm install npm init -y ````
 
 - For this environment, __webpack__, __webpack-cli__ and __webpack-dev-server__ has been configured as development dependencies. Moreover, it has been required to use the following plugins and modules to fulfill the project requirements: 
 
 # Plugins:
 
 1. The Webpack's built-in **ProvidePlugin** has been used to import automatically jQuery when the __$__ or __jQuery__ variables are parsed.
 
 2. **HtmlWebpackPlugin** has been used to generate the _index.html_ file for the _dist_ bundle folder, using the _index.html_ file located in the _src_ folder as a template. It generates an HTML5 file that includes all your webpack bundles in the body using script tags. To install this plugin manually, the next command must be run:

```` npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin ````

 3. **ImageMinimizerPlugin** has been used to generated compressed images in the _src/images_ folder. To install manually this plugin  and some other required tools for different files formats, the next command must be run:
 
 ```` npm install --save-dev imagemin-gifsicle imagemin-mozjpeg imagemin-pngquant imagemin-svgo ````
 
 4. **CssMinimizerWebpackPlugin** has been used to minimize CSS which is generated by the **css-loader** and **sass-loader**. To install this plugin manually, the next command must be run:

```` npm install --save-dev css-minimizer-webpack-plugin ````

5. **MiniCssExtractPlugin** has been used to generate a CSS file in _dist/styles_ folder as _main.css_, and make an import from the _index.html_ file. To install this plugin manually, the next command must be run:

```` npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin ````

 # Loaders:
 
 1. **html-loader** to parse the HTML as a string. It's required to load referenced images for the bundle.
 
 ```` npm install --save-dev html-loader ````
 
 2. **css-loader** and **sass-loader** to parse and load the style code for the _index.html_ file in the _dist_ folder. 
 
 ```` npm install --save-dev sass sass-loader  ````
 
 3. **babel-loader** to transpile _JavaScript_ files for the _index.html_ file in the _dist_ folder.
 
 ```` npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpack ````

# Modules:

**Asset Module** is used to load all image related type of files for the _dist_ folder.

 ## Run
 
 Some commands has been configured for _npm_, which can be used once all depencies had been installed:
 - Run ````npm run build```` to build a bundle from _src_ folder. It will create (by default) the _dist_ `folder with the bundled files.
 - Run ````npm start```` to launch a live web server with automatic reloading, so that every time changes are made the _src_ files will be recompiled.
