## Getting Start

To inicialize the project, you must run:

>npm install

All dependencies will install in the project, so you can compile the code runinng:

>npm run build

This command will create a folder **dist** where you will have the main index.html with all assets linked.

## Requirements

- You must make use of the new features of ECMAScript 6
- You must import several files so that the final result is a single bundle for Javascript and a single bundle for sass
- Verify that the output bundle generated by WebPack for the Javascript layer has made the transformation from ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5
- Create a clear and orderly directory structure
