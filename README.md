# WebPack Basics 
We built a JS bundle thanks to webpack, using "entry" and "output", This bundle was built
from main.js wich imported modules a and b, we also imported main.scss. The css bundle were 
deployed from scss files using MiniCssExtractPlugin, css-loader and sass-loader.

The HtmlWebpackPlugin was used to create the index.html into ./dist with linked js and css bundles.

To load images, we installed the file-loader and created a module for different image
formats. We used after the ImageMinimizerPlugin to compress images.
