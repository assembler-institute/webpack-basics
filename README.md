> It mainly solves Javascript dependencies, although it can also work with css, images, Javascript preprocessors, CSS preprocessors, template systems, and much more.

## Setup

This section is meant to explain the process followed to install webpack and the specific plugins used for this project.
 - First, install the required packages that are specified in the _*package.json_* file running the below _*npm*_ command. This will create the _node_modules_ folder with all the environment dependencies.
 
 ```` npm install npm init -y ````
 
 - For this environment, __webpack__, __webpack-cli__ and __webpack-dev-server__ has been configured as development dependencies. Moreover, it has been required to use the following plugins and modules to fulfill the project requirements: 
 
 # Plugins:
 
 1. The Webpack's built-in **ProvidePlugin** has been used to import automatically jQuery when the __$__ or __jQuery__ variables are parsed.
 2. **HtmlWebpackPlugin** has been used to generate the _index.html_ file for the _dist_ bundle folder, from the _index.html_ located in the _src_ folder used as a template. It generates an HTML5 file that includes all your webpack bundles in the body using script tags. To install this plugin manually, the next command must be run:

```` npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin ````

 3. **ImageMinimizerPlugin** has been used to generated compressed images in the _src/images_ folder. To install manually this plugin  and some other required tools for different files formats, the next command must be run:
 
 ```` npm install --save-dev imagemin-gifsicle imagemin-mozjpeg imagemin-pngquant imagemin-svgo ````
 
 4. **CssMinimizerWebpackPlugin** has been used to minimize CSS which is generated by the **css-loader** and **sass-loader**. To install this plugin manually, the next command must be run:

```` npm install --save-dev css-minimizer-webpack-plugin ````

5. **MiniCssExtractPlugin** has been used to generate a CSS file in _dist/styles_ folder as _main.css_, and make an import from the _index.html_ file. To install this plugin manually, the next command must be run:

```` npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin ````

 # Loaders:
 
 1. **html-loader** to load html code for the _index.html_ file in the _dist_ folder. 
 ```` { test: /\.html$/i, loader: 'html-loader' } ````
 1. **style-loader, css-loader** and **sass-loader** to process and load the style code for the _index.html_ file in the _dist_ folder. 
 ```` npm install sass-loader sass webpack ````
 2. **asset** to load all image related type of files for the _index.html_ file in the _dist_ folder.
 ```` { test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i, type: 'asset', } ````
 3. **babel-loader** to transpile JavaScript files for the _index.html_ file in the _dist_ folder.
 ```` npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpack ````


 ## Configuration
 - Entry and output:  Webpack needs an entry point, that will serve as the base to begin building its dependencies related to the other modules. The default entry file is ````index.js````.  The output property sets the place where the bundle created by webpack will be emitted to.
 ```` module.exports = { entry: './src/index.js', output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), filename: 'bundle.js' } ````
 ## Get it working
 - After the webpack is properly set up, you can run ````npm run build```` to compile it. It will create (by default) the ````./dist```` `folder with ````bundle.js```` among other files. - You can also use the ````webpack-dev-server````, that provides you with a web server with live reloading so you don't have to manually compile the code every time you make changes.
