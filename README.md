## Modules used

\* **Babel**: is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.

\* **HtmlWebpackPlugin**: simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation.

\* **MiniCSSExtractPlugin**: extracts CSS into separate files. It creates a CSS file per JS file which contains CSS. It supports On-Demand-Loading of CSS and SourceMaps.

\* **URL-Loader**: a loader for webpack which transforms files into base64 URIs.

\* **JQuery**: the purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
