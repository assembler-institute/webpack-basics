> WebPack is a tool that allows you to manage the resources and dependencies of a website.
>
> It mainly solves Javascript dependencies, although it can also work with css, images, Javascript preprocessors, CSS preprocessors, template systems, and much more.
>
> Here you'll find a src folder which contains the main files used to create the website and a dist folder with the result of having used Webpack.

## Requirements

- You must make use of the new features of ECMAScript 6
- You must import several files so that the final result is a single bundle for Javascript and a single bundle for sass
- Verify that the output bundle generated by WebPack for the Javascript layer has made the transformation from ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5
- Create a clear and orderly directory structure

## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

First of all you should install Webpack and Webpack CLI. If you want to have an automatic reload of the result page made with Webpack, you should install the webpack server

Install

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli # install the CLI
npm install webpack-dev-server  # install the server
```

## Approach #1: Using Javascript with Webpack

A main.js file that will be your main Javascript file responsible for calling the modules that your application needs.

Inside the webpack.config.js, you must include:

```Javascript
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/js/main.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "index.js",
  },
  mode: "production",
}
```

A file called module-a.js that contains a javascript module that makes use of the new features of ECMAScript 6.

A file called module-b.js that contains a javascript module that makes use of the JQuery library.

First install jQuery:

```
npm install jquery
```

Then, configure webpack to load the jquery plugin:

```Javascript
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        $: "jquery",
        jQuery: "jquery",
      }),
    ],
}
```

## Approach #2: Using Sass with Webpack

create 3 sass files to style come text:

- colors.scss that applies the css style related to colors.
- text.scss that applies the css style related to text.
- main.scss which imports the colors.scss and text.scss files

First, install css and sass loaders:

```
npm install style-loader css-loader
npm install sass-loader sass webpack
```

Now configure the loaders already installed:

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
module.exports = {
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          // Creates `style` nodes from JS strings
          "style-loader",
          // Translates CSS into CommonJS
          "css-loader",
          // Compiles Sass to CSS
          "sass-loader",
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Approach #3: loading images with webpack

4 files have been created to load them with Webpack:

1. Png image weighing less than 8kb
2. Svg with a weight less than 8kb
3. Png image with a weight greater than 12kb
4. Image .jpg with a weight greater than 1MB

You should convert image size less than 12kb and compress the rest of PNG, JPG, GIF and SVG images. To achieve that use the webpack configuration below:

```javascript
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpg|svg)$/i,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "url-loader",
            options: {
              limit: 12000,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
```

Now, you can use import to load the images:

```javascript
import small from "../img/small.png";
```

## Approach #4: Injecting HTML with webpack

In this part you should create an index.html file that serves as an entry point to the application. It is necessary that this file automatically includes the assets generated.

Once created, you install the following plugin to convert the index.html file:

```
npm install html-webpack-plugin
```

Then execute the npm run build command

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Repository

First of all you must fork this project into your GitHub account.

To create a fork on GitHub is as easy as clicking the “fork” button on the repository page.
