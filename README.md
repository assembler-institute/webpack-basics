> WebPack is a tool that allows you to manage the resources and dependencies of a website. 
>
> It mainly solves Javascript dependencies, although it can also work with css, images, Javascript preprocessors, CSS preprocessors, template systems, and much more.

## Requirements

- You must make use of the new features of ECMAScript 6
- You must import several files so that the final result is a single bundle for Javascript and a single bundle for sass
- Verify that the output bundle generated by WebPack for the Javascript layer has made the transformation from ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5
- Create a clear and orderly directory structure


## Repository

First of all you must fork this project into your GitHub account.

To create a fork on GitHub is as easy as clicking the “fork” button on the repository page.

### To start this web write this command in the terminal

````
 npm install

````
 
### To transpile the project with webpack execute this:

````
npm run build

````





# Guidelines




## Webpack basics
Webpack is a management application that allows to develop your projects in modules.
##### To install webpack:
````
npm install --save-dev webpack
````
Once you have webpack installed, you'll have to create this file : 

### webpack.config.js

The management of the modules in your project will be handled from this file.

- Here you will create an object called <b>module.exports</b>
- Within this object we specify to webpack which js files you want to compile:

`````
{
  entry: "./src/js/main.js",
  mode: "production",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
`````
#### In 'entry' we define the index.js file where we import the javascript modules

````
import "./module-a.js";
import "./module-b.js";
````

#### In 'output' we define where we want to export the bundled project
````
output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  }
````
## Creating rules

#### Webpack works by default with javascript files, in order to transpile other kind of files (as html, images, styles...) you will need to install certain external 'plugins' and add 'rules' 

The <b>rules</b> are inserted in the object <b>modules</b> as well as <b>plugins</b>.There are both an array of objects, where each of those object are a rule (in the array of rules) and a plugin (in the array of plugins)


### Creating rules and plugins


- To manage the main HTML 
  - To transpile HTML files you need to install an [external plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/).
  Webpack doesn't have this functionality by default 
  - Once you have this plugin installed [write the rule](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/html-loader/)

- To manage the styles you have to write a new [rule](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/)
  this rule works in three ways:
  - Creates `style` nodes from JS strings
  ````
  "style-loader"
  ````
  - Insert CSS styles to the main JS.
   ````
  "css-loader"
  ````
  - Compile CSS to SCSS.
   ````
  "style-loader"
  ````


- To manage images: 
  - Assets modules, here you have [4 assets modules](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/)
  options; we use "assets"
  - To run this asset you need to have included [HTML loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/html-loader/)


- To compress the image we installed the plugin :
  [ImageMinimizerPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin/).
  Also we need to add to this plugin a filter to limit which images will be compressed depending of there size:
  ````
  filter: (source) => {
          if (source.byteLength >= 8192) { // = 8kb limit
            return true;
          }

          return false;
        },
  ````
    
- To manage the jQuery package you will need to install a plugin [click here](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/provide-plugin/)

- In order to make our JS code backwards compatible to ECMAScript 5 we use [Babel](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/) transpiler.
