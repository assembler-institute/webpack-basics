> WebPack is a tool that allows you to manage the resources and dependencies of a website.
>
> It mainly solves Javascript dependencies, although it can also work with css, images, Javascript preprocessors, CSS preprocessors, template systems, and much more.
>
> Here you'll find a src folder which contains the main files used to create the website and a dist folder with the result of having used Webpack.

## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

First of all you should install Webpack and Webpack CLI. If you want to have an automatic reload of the result page made with Webpack, you should install the webpack server

Install

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli # install the CLI
npm install webpack-dev-server  # install the server
```

## Approach #1: Using Javascript with Webpack.

A main.js file that will be your main Javascript file responsible for calling the modules that your application needs.

Inside the webpack.config.js, you must include:

```Javascript
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/js/main.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "index.js",
  },
  mode: "production",
}
```

A file called module-a.js that contains a javascript module that makes use of the new features of ECMAScript 6.

A file called module-b.js that contains a javascript module that makes use of the JQuery library.

First install jQuery:

```
npm install jquery
```

Then, configure webpack to load the jquery plugin:

```Javascript
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        $: "jquery",
        jQuery: "jquery",
      }),
    ],
}
```

## Approach #2: Using Sass with Webpack.

A sass file called main.scss (which will be responsible for importing the colors.scss and text.scss files)

## Requirements

- You must make use of the new features of ECMAScript 6
- You must import several files so that the final result is a single bundle for Javascript and a single bundle for sass
- Verify that the output bundle generated by WebPack for the Javascript layer has made the transformation from ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5
- Create a clear and orderly directory structure

## Repository

First of all you must fork this project into your GitHub account.

To create a fork on GitHub is as easy as clicking the “fork” button on the repository page.
